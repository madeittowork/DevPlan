> Developer Log: October 2024 


## October 6 2024
#### Accomplishments
- Github created and explored
- VSC Created and explored
- First repository: Full stack dev plan created using a little bit of MD
- Learned how to Commit, push and pull between GitHub and VSC
- Learned *Markdown*  in more depth: tips and cheat sheet in "Notes": Markdown.md

#### Concerns
- Not sure if I set up VSC correctly, didn't watch video but I managed to get it working with GitHub today which was the goal

#### Highlights
- Learned .md file type means markdown: would like to learn what the other file types are and what they do
- Can split screen with MD:
**CTRL+SHIFT+P** = Preview   
*"Markdown open preview to the side"*  
Fantastic, so I dont have to update all the way through GH to see if there were any mistakes like what I was first doing






##### Over all
Very happy with my first day! In 3-4 hours I feel like I accomplished a decent amount with just a couple youtube videos. Smoljames & Web Dev Simplified have been very helpful!
