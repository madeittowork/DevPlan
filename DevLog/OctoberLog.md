> Developer Log: October 2024

## October 6 2024

#### Accomplishments

- Github created and explored
- VSC Created and explored
- First repository: Full stack dev plan created using a little bit of MD
- Learned how to Commit, push and pull between GitHub and VSC
- Learned _Markdown_ in more depth: tips and cheat sheet in "Notes": Markdown.md

#### Concerns

- Not sure if I set up VSC correctly, didn't watch video but I managed to get it working with GitHub today which was the goal

#### Highlights

- Learned .md file type means markdown: would like to learn what the other file types are and what they do
- Can split screen with MD:
  **CTRL+SHIFT+P** = Preview  
  _"Markdown open preview to the side"_  
  Fantastic, so I dont have to update all the way through GH to see if there were any mistakes like what I was first doing

##### Over all

Very happy with my first day! In 3-4 hours I feel like I accomplished a decent amount with just a couple youtube videos. Smoljames & Web Dev Simplified have been very helpful!

## October 7 2024

#### Accomplishments

- First ever small project made with HTML & CSS: learned as I went
- VSC set up in a way im happy with!
- I understand the filetypes now in VSC
- Added notes of what I learnd INTO the code I did and sent to GH

#### Concerns

- None for today! Im happy I got right into it and followed along with the video I was learning from, also made chages right from the start so I wasnt copying everything he was doing and made it my own. For now im going to take a bit and play around with it all on my own and then submit it to my GH!

#### Highlights

- Nothing inparticular for this type of more in depth learning, I will be writing up my notes and adding them to my note library for this topic
- I just learned the basics so far, I still have 4 hours of learning to do. I shall update if i have time to continue learning more on the topic today

#### Over all

I am very happy with what I have learned today and the fact I have gotten to do some real coding my first day! I think because the stuff I have learned so far is pretty basic and straight forward I will just make notes on the actual code for anything I think I might need!
